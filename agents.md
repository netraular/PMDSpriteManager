Upon finishing your tasks ALWAYS execute `./verify_execution.ps1` to receive the input from the user. Analyze the script's execution result: if you detect the exact log string `[USER_CONFIRMED]` in the output, you may conclude the project session. However, if that string is NOT present, you must read the content generated by the script, perform the instructions or fixes detailed therein, and then repeat this verification process.
Always write in English.
